<body> <h1>The SSOAP package</h1>
<p align="right">Latest Release:
  <a href="SSOAP_0.9-0.tar.gz">0.9-0</a> (<font color="red">12 Jan 2012</font>)</p>

<p>
This package provides a client-side
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">SOAP (Simple Object Access
Protocol)</a> mechanism for
S.  It aims to provide a high-level interface for S users to invoke
SOAP methods provided by a SOAP server.  Conversion from S arguments to
SOAP representation and of SOAP results to S objects is intended to be
both transparent and extensible.

<p/>
The current version has facilities for reading WSDL
(Web Service Description Language)
files and creating
S functions from such files to programmatically create
S bindings for a SOAP server's methods.
This currently works for KEGG
which provides an automated package similar
to the BioConductor package KEGGSOAP.
There are more details to add to make this
entirely general, but the basis is already
present.

<p>

The package is an example of using XML, but will be useful in its own
right.
The <a href="SSOAP_0.1-2.tar.gz">original version</a>s of this package used their own
HTTP communication mechanism. The more recent versions
use the <a href="../RCurl/">RCurl</a> package
which is a significant improvement in
terms of performance, flexibility and thoroughness.

  <dd> Installation should be simple since there is no
      native (i.e. C or Fortran) code and no third party
      libraries. You will need the <a
      href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSXML/">XML</a>
      and <a href="../RCurl/">RCurl</a> packages.
      See the instructions for installing these.

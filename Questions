Created a PrimitiveSOAPType object when we are dealing with 
  an XML element with an "all" in processWSDLType.
 XXX Done in getSOAPType().   Needs to be generalized.


  Need an object returned in the element-wise processing of 
         processSchemaTypes

    processWSDLType



* Class definitions   from the Axis generated WSDL

  processSchemaTypes
  processWSDLTypes

 Is it working now?  Handling complexType.


* Use the encoding/namespaces defined from the WSDL in the generated code.
  e.g. the schema
  e.g. the output from SOAPNameSpaces()

* Deal with import of schemas. See KEGG.wsdl


* Ability to specify a C routine to do the conversion
  especially of the return value.

   Two methods:  base 64 encoding in the body
                 or as an emal attachment.



* Get the port number version
   Use parseURI from XML package. Added for this.

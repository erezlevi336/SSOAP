<h1>Change log for SSOAP package</h1>

<h2>0.8-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Further changes to toSOAP() and adding the content to an XML
      node. Identified by Jeff Allen.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.8-2</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fix for creating . Identified by Dylan Beaudette.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.8-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Restored the ability to the generated interface code and
      classes to a file that can be source()ed into another R session
       or used as code in a package. See writeInterface().
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.7-0</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Support for HTTP GET and POST methods for WSDL.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> New, simpler approach to processing/gathering schema types.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Support for many more WSDLs/schema.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Significant improvements to XMLSchema and mapping descriptions
       of data types to and from XML.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.6-0</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li>  Added methods to coerce a list to an S4 object so that the
       caller  of a WSDL method expecting an S4 object(s) can provide
       just a list of the slots.
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li> Discard parameters in WSDL methods that call for an empty object/element.
  <dd>

      
  <dt>
  <li> Allow the caller to specify which port by name or by number to
       allow the selection of differnt types of interfaces.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Added more support for targetNamespace and elementFormDefault.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
      <li> Many changes (along with those to XMLSchema) to process
	  more data types and WSDLs.
  <dd>	  
  <dt>
  <li> Support for processing &lt;wsdl:import:gt; nodes in addition to
       schema import nodes.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-7</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fixes for working with brenda.wsdl.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Removed the XMLRPC functions. See the XMLRPC package.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-6</h2>

<h2>0.5-5</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Patches from Alexandre Rademaker.
      <ul>
	<li> processWSDL() when "XMLAbstractDocument" passed.
	<li> Fix PDF documentation for Users Guide
      </ul>
</dl>      


<h2>0.5-5</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Patches from Seth Falcon to fix methods for $, UTF-8 issues
      with quotes, etc. (Thanks.)
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-4</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fixed a bug in creating the XML for the body of the request
      and converting the arguments to XML in toSOAP().
  <dd> The issue was parenting and reparenting the new nodes.
     These are added to the parent explicitly in writeSOAPBody() rather than
     implicitly in the toSOAP() methods.
</dl>

<h2>0.5-3</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Added support for dealing with fancy quotes when processing
      method definitions and generating R code.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Suport for elementFormQualified in .SOAP() and
       genSOAPClientInterface() from the schema definition.
  <dd> This controls whether XML elements representing arguments in
      SOAP method calls use the target namespace of the method
      or not.
</dl>

<h2>0.5-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Update toSOAP methods to work with XMLInternalDocument objects
       rather than connections.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.5-0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Introduced richer support for date, datetime and time types,
       allowing the user to specify values as POSIXt or character types.
  <dd>  Classes SOAPDate, SOAPDateTime and SOAPTime used to aid in
        writing methods for toSOAP() and fromSOAP().
  
  <dt>
  <li> [Important] Functions generated from the WSDL use ... as the arguments for
       the  RCurl parameters .opts, i.e. .opts = list(...)
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Added .soapHeader parameter to .SOAP function to allow a
        function, XML node,  or XML text to be supplied as the
        content for the header node of the SOAP Envelope.
  <dd>  This is often used for authentication, etc. in the SOAP request.

  <dt>
  <li>  Added addSoapHeader parameter to genSOAPClientInterface() to
        control whether .soapHeader is added as a parameter to each
        generated function.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Generating converters from XML nodes to instances of the
       defined WSDL classes and arrays directly
       rather than determining the conversion steps run-time.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Use the converter function rather than the type in the .convert.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  .convert argument to .SOAP can be the name of a class and will
      be used in a call to as(xmlNode, .convert).
       This allows one to define setAs() methods for converting
        XMLAbstractNode objects to 
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Using XMLInternalNode objects to create the envelope (header,
        body) of the SOAP request
  <dd>
      
  
  <dt>
  <li>  Additions to handle different aspects of XML schema in WSDL files.
  <dd>
</dl>  


<h2>0.4-8</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Avoid using dQuote() when creating code for function
    definitions as, within certain locales, this can create code that is
    not parseable by R.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.4-7</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Better handling of anyType.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Handle case when there are no types.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.4-6</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Some documentation fixes and generally fixing up warnings.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.4-5</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> resolve() methods handle working with multiple schema and being able to resolve,
      e.g., fields with types in different schemas. 
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li>  Added support for xsd:anyType.
 <dd>
     
 <dt>
 <li> Use a class SOAPResolveError for signalling errors related to
      resolving types in schema so that we can catch those errors.
 <dd>
</dl>


<h2>0.4-4</h2>
<dl>
   Changes for dealing with WSDL files

  <dt>
  <li>  Added the arguments passed via the ... in generated functions
        to the actual .SOAP() call,
        e.g. for nameSpaces
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Handle description of fields/elements in structures more
      directly so that the generated code is more complete.
  <dd>
  <dt>
  <li> Handle more cases during the processing (e.g. element nodes
      that point to other nodes in the schema).
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> .SOAP accepts nameSpaces argument as the name of an element in
      the .SOAPDefaultNameSpaces list, e.g. "1.1" or "1.2"
      as well as a character vector of alias=URI pairs
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Handle enumeration types.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Examples of WSDL code generation in examples/KEGG.S and
      tests/interop.R work.
       Can also process eBay developer's WSDL. (More work needed to
       make the calls with the authentication.)
  <dd>

      
      
</dl>

<h2>0.4-3</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
   <li> Removed the setGeneric() for "names" that prohibited the
       package from being installed after changes to the methods package.    
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.4-2</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Fix for the emission of warnings for nodes of the
       form <xsd:string>value</value> when attempting to convert them
       from SOAP to R.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> processWSDL() now separates the different schema in the types
      node into SchemaContainer and creates "SchemaTypes" lists
      with methods for resolve() to make the lookup of a particular
      type more structured.
      
  <dd>
      
</dl>

<h2>0.4-1</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  Fix for the generation of the URL from a SOAPServer object
        which incorrectly inserted a port.  The parsing of the URI
        using the XML package returned a value of 0 rather than NA
        when there is no port. Fixed in XML package and here.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>0.4-0</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>
 <li> Tested using HTTPS (HTTP over SSL).
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Determine the protocol (http, https, etc.) from the SOAPServer object
 <dd> See getProtocol() which is not exported.

 <dt>
 <li> Support for base64Binary return types types.
 <dd>  Need RCurl >= 0.8-0

 <dt>
 <li> Honor the fromConverter in the BasicSOAPType objects when converting 
      a SOAP response to R.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li>  SOAPTypes structure has changed so each element is a list and can contain
      converter functions for convert to SOAP from R (to), and to R from SOAP (from).
 <dd>  

 <dt>
 <li> Issue: Still issues with namespaces and matching prefix to URIs
      when resolving types. 
 <dd>     
</dl>


<h2>0.3-0</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Programmatically generated bindings perform coercion of
      both arguments to the appropriate type and
      of the return value  class,
      if the return type is a newly defined class in the WSDL file.</li>
  <dd>
    
  <dt>
  <li>parseArrayType() returns a single ArrayType object (not a list
    of ArrayType objects) with a vector giving the dimensions of the
    nested arrays. </li>
  <dd> More work to check if this covers the complete set of cases is needed.


  <dt>
  <li>Fix for processing the updated KEGG WSDL</li>
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Added some support for using/checking namespaces in the
  processing of the schema.</li>
  <dd>  
  <dt>
  <li> New interface for calling methods via a server
       object, i.e. <code>keggServer$list_databases()</code>.
  <dd> The server is created from a "SOAPClientInterface" instance
       created from <code>genSOAPClientInterface</code>.


  <dt>
  <li> Added a server argument to genSOAPClientInterface() which
       defaults to the server description object read from the
       WSDL file. This can however be used to create 
  <dd>    
  <dt>
  <li> Functions generated via genSOAPClientInterface()
       (and createOperationDefinition()) now have an explicit
       environment whose parent is that specified via the env argument
       (of both functions).
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> Added a curlHandle arguemnt .SOAP so that one can supply
       previously created handles with options, connections, etc.
       to the SOAP operation.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> processWSDL takes a handler argument that is used to perform
       imports, etc. The default is an internal function in the
       package named WSDLParseHandlers.
      
  <dd>
      
</dl>

<h2>0.2-4</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> fromSOAPArray() calls unlist to create a vector if the element
      types are primitive (i.e. numbers, strings, logicals).
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li> Deals better with element type objects (i.e. SOAPType) when explicitly passed to fromSOAPArray
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Update KEGG.wsdl to new version.
       And the KEGG.S examples to use class slots rather than list
      elements,
       i.e.  iface@functions rather than  iface$functions.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Handle NULL return values in fromSOAPArray as this function can be
      called when the type is known from, e.g.,  processing a WSDL
      file but the return value is actually NULL.
  <dd>
      
</dl>

<h2>0.2-3</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>
    <li> License switched to GPL2 from BSD.
    <dd> Previous versions are still available under the BSD license.

    <dt>
    <li> Empty/zero-length arrays are returned as character(0),
  	integer(0), numeric(0), logical(0), etc. as appropriate to the
 	element type or list(0). This is a change from returning NULL.
    <dd>
	
    <dt>
    <li> Fix in fromSOAPArray when computing the name of the type from
  	 the arrayType attribute.
    <dd> The array declaration is now parsed more thoroughly and an
    	 ArrayType object with the dimensions is created.

    <dt>
    <li> Global option SSOAP:DefaultNamespace that can be set to "1.1"
 	 or "1.2"
    <dt> The naming convention (pkg:variable name) is consistent with
    	 XML attributes and probably a reasonable one to adopt for R's
         namespace mechanism and options for particular packages.

    <dt>
    <li> Patch from Nigel Sim to handle soapenc: namespace entries.
    <dd>
	
    <dt>
    <li> dims field added to ArrayType class.
    <dd>	
  </dl>


<h2>0.2-2</h2>

<h2>0.2-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>  isHTTPError() recognizes status codes 100, 200, 201, ..., 206
        as being error-free responses.
  <dd>  The 100 error message is for CONTINUE, but hopefully can be
        ignored since the entire request was sent by the client.

  <dt>
  <li>   Documentation updates and fixed trivial documentation links.
  <dd>


  <dt>
  <li>  Support for WSDL still needs some work in the case of arrays
      of complex types.  More to come on reading Schema generally.
  <dd>
      
      
</dl>


<h2>0.2-0</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Support for reading WSDL files  (either locally or via HTTP)
       and generating S interface to the server and its methods.
  <dd>
      
  <dt>
  <li> UseDashInNames option in R can now be set to control whether
     the function, field and class names generated during the
     processing of the WSDL information are converted to
     myRoutine or left as my_routine.

  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li> Use RCurl to implement the HTTP request.
  <dd>
</dl>
